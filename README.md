# MechaCar Statistical Analysis
## Purpose:
* Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
* Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
* Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
* Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

2. Key Findings:

* The results show that vehicle_length, vehicle_weight and ground_clearance variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.
* Th slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because p-value is much less than the significance level 0.05.
* The linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively because r-squared value is 0.7 which indicated a strong positive realtionship between the car variables and mpg.
